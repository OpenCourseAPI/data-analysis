pip install pipenv
# OR
pip3 install pipenv
```

Clone [live-fhda-class-data](https://github.com/OpenCourseAPI/live-fhda-class-data) and this repo, and install its dependencies:

```bash
mkdir opencourse
cd opencourse

git clone https://github.com/OpenCourseAPI/live-fhda-class-data.git

cd data-analysis
pipenv install # this may take some time
